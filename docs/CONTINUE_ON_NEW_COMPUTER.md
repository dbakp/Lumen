# Continue Lumen on a new computer

Handoff date: 29 October 2026. The development goal was paused at the user's request. Batch 9 has not started. The latest application batch is published on `main` as `86bc68f8c529adfeac8671b7c465f9f3ff117d80`.

Clone this repository on the new computer, then give the new assistant the prompt below. Attach **app-designer-pro (1).zip** to carry over the original design skill; that attachment is not bundled in this repository. Personal health history and credentials need separate transfer: GitHub contains the application code and synthetic design/test artifacts. Use the app's backup/restore controls for health history where applicable; configure accounts and permissions on the new device separately.

## Continuation prompt

/goal Continue developing Lumen into a world-class, primarily iOS, AI health assistant.

Repository: https://github.com/dbakp/Lumen  
Latest published application commit: `86bc68f8c529adfeac8671b7c465f9f3ff117d80`  
Branch: `main`

Clone the repository on this computer and inspect its current state before making changes. Continue implementation autonomously in coherent batches. Verify and push each completed batch separately to GitHub. Never force-push or overwrite unrelated changes.

### Product intent

- A premium, harmonious, beautiful, light-first native experience.
- Import and connect health data, especially Apple Health.
- Give useful insights grounded in actual sleep, food, hydration, exercise, symptoms and personal context.
- Replace generic notifications with restrained contextual reminders.
- Support detailed symptom and body-pain logs, ongoing health conversations, practical plans and saved documents.
- Research meaningful market gaps where useful and implement valuable missing functionality.

### Read first

- [README](../README.md)
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
- [Verification evidence](VERIFICATION.md)
- [Implementation plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- [Import formats](IMPORT_FORMATS.md)
- [Conversational logging](CONVERSATIONAL_LOGGING.md)
- [Design direction](../Design/DIRECTION.md)
- [Design critiques](../Design/CRITIQUE.md)

Use the attached App Designer Pro skill. Preserve the established design direction. Use one independent design critic for native UI changes, address substantive findings, and capture actual simulator screens. `Design/native-preview.html` presents captured screens; it is not the application.

### Completed and published through batch 8

- Contextual Today, symptoms/check-ins, personal context and quiet reminders.
- Persistent conversations with cancellation and reply ownership.
- Editable dated plans, agenda and Library documents.
- Coverage-aware historical Insights and appointment summaries.
- Validated backup/restore, including meal photos.
- Cancellable imports with progress.
- Direct Apple Health ZIP imports with validation, extraction integrity and cleanup.
- Historical workouts and additional health signals, provenance and duplicate reconciliation.
- Reviewable conversational logging for symptoms, check-ins, water and workouts. Each entry requires explicit confirmation. Optional AI suggestions use the selected user message; missing or unsupported measurements remain blank. Original messages are separate from optional notes. Edited drafts have Close/swipe protection.

### Latest validation

- 173 production-logic checks passed.
- All native targets built for the simulator.
- Final conversational logging and assistant-continuity scenario passed in 144.131 seconds.
- Broader daily/Library/conversation/backup journey separately passed in 252.272 seconds.
- Design reviewer confirmed the scoped additions at 4/5 with no remaining high-impact visual findings.
- These results establish simulator behavior, not real-device AI or clinical reliability. Temporary result bundles on the previous computer are not portable; committed screenshots and verification reports are available in this repository. Re-run relevant checks on this computer.

### Next batch: data confidence and corrections

1. Distinguish missing readings from genuinely recorded zeros throughout Today, Activity, Insights and assistant context.
2. Add per-metric source/freshness evidence. HealthKit access requests do not prove every data type is readable.
3. Preserve live recorded zeros when reconciling imports.
4. Avoid presenting profile defaults or stale measurements as current observations.
5. Allow correction/deletion of locally confirmed water and workout entries, preserving provenance and updating dependent views/context.
6. Keep external-source records separate from local edits and make HealthKit write-back behavior explicit.

Continue the remaining roadmap afterward. Background HealthKit delivery, broader ingestion/OCR, richer retrieval, voice, larger/encrypted backups, provider integrations and release/device validation remain unfinished. Audit current files rather than assuming this list is exhaustive.

### Engineering and delivery

- Native SwiftUI Xcode project: `Lumen.xcodeproj`, scheme `Lumen`.
- Logic checks: `scripts/test-imports.sh`.
- Native tests: `LumenUITests/LumenSmokeTests.swift`.
- Discover this computer's Xcode installation and simulator IDs; previous-machine paths and IDs are not portable. The previous environment used Xcode 27.1 and an iOS 27 simulator.
- Do not run concurrent Xcode builds against the same DerivedData directory.
- `scripts/publish-batches.sh` publishes committed batches individually and rejects dirty/divergent state. Configure GitHub authentication with write access to `dbakp/Lumen` on this computer; previous-machine authentication is not transferred by cloning.
- Preserve old local-data decoding and backup compatibility.
- Do not push personal health data, credentials or real-user screenshots.
- Do not fabricate integrations, measurements, diagnoses or verification.
- Keep the full goal active until its requirements are actually implemented and verified; report external device/account/release dependencies honestly.
